            <p>My Radar is a anti-theft device that uses an ultrasonic sensor to detect objects and alert the user via a mobile app.
            It uses a simple servo motor to monitor around the surrounding area.
            It is designed to be used in conjunction with a bicycle lock, providing an additional layer of security. The device is powered by a ESP32 Dev Module and communicates with a mobile app an access WiFi point.</p>

            <p>
